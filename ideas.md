Follow-up post ideas (scoped and practical)
1. Why TableTest instead of @CsvSource?

- Focus: readability, scenario names, grouped inputs, less boilerplate, failure messages.
- Show a small “before vs after” using JUnit 5 @ParameterizedTest + @CsvSource vs TableTest.
- Include a failure-output screenshot/snippet to highlight scenario-based display names.

1. Grouped inputs and readable failure output

- Show how {…} expands to multiple cases, how display names look, and how to keep tables short.
- Tips for keeping groups coherent and failure triage fast.

1. Converters: enums, dates, and custom types

- Built-in conversions you support.
- How to register custom converters (and where to put them).
- Handling nulls and “no value” cases; escaping pipes or special characters.

1. Fixtures and per-row customization

- Sharing setup across table rows; when to extract helpers vs overloading the table.
- Optional per-row metadata (e.g., tolerance, tags) and how to use it in the test method.

1. Comparing frameworks: JUnit + CsvSource, Spock, Kotest, Cucumber

- Keep it respectful and task-oriented: when to choose each.
- Suggested comparison dimensions:
    - Readability of example sets
    - Boilerplate/ergonomics
    - Failure diagnostics
    - Type conversion and custom data
    - IDE/test runner reporting
    - Mixed-language teams (Java + Kotlin)

- End with guidance: “Pick X when you want specifications as prose (Cucumber), Y when you want powerful DSLs (Kotest/Spock), TableTest when you want tabular, low-boilerplate examples with named scenarios.”

1. From examples to contract: collaborating with domain experts

- Show a real-world-ish table that evolved through conversations.
- Tips for naming scenarios, grouping, and keeping tables business-friendly.

Optional micro-posts
- Handling large tables: splitting by rule, using grouped inputs, naming patterns.
- Making flaky/stateful tests work (or deciding not to use tables there).
- IDE experience: navigating failures by scenario.
